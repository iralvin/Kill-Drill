# Kill-Drill
Play as Pickles to defend the Earth!

During gameplay, oil rigs will spawn randomly around the outer edges of the Earth. Each oil rig will randomly spawn 
varying numbers of drills that will drill towards the center. As Pickles, you must "sling-shot" peanuts into the drills
and rigs in order to destroy them. Combo your kills to get a high score!

How to play:
- Touch on Pickles and pull in the opposite direction you want to shoot a peanut (sling-shot style).
- Holding the "sling-shot" will charge up the peanuts. These charged up peanuts are now spicy peanuts, they will 
  destroy anything in it's path. 
- Only spicy peanuts can destroy oil rigs.
- Each kill will charge up your EMP meter. Activating the EMP will freeze are current oil rigs & drills temporarily.
- Enter your name on the high score screen. High scores are saved locally via PlayerPrefs.
